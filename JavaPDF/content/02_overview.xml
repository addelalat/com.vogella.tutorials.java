	<para>iText has a hierarchical structure. The smallest text unit is a
		"Chunk" which is a String with a pre-defined font. A "Phrase" combines
		several Chunks and allows to define line spacing. "Paragraph" is a
		subclass of "Phrase" and allows to define more layout attributes, e.g.
		margins. The class "Anchor" is a subclass of "Paragraph" and serves as
		the basis for hyperlinks in the generated PDF.
