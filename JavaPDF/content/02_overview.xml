== Overview
	
		iText is a Java library originally created by Bruno Lowagie which
		allows to create PDF, read PDF and manipulate them.
		The following
		tutorial will show how to create PDF files with
		iText. This tutorial
		assumes that you have basis

		and

		knowledge.
	

	iText has a hierarchical structure. The smallest text unit is a
		"Chunk" which is a String with a pre-defined font. A "Phrase" combines
		several Chunks and allows to define line spacing. "Paragraph" is a
		subclass of "Phrase" and allows to define more layout attributes, e.g.
		margins. The class "Anchor" is a subclass of "Paragraph" and serves as
		the basis for hyperlinks in the generated PDF.
