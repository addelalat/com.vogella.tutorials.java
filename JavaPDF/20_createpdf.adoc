== Create a PDF
	
Create a new Java project "de.vogella.itext.write" with the package
"de.vogella.itext.write".
Create a folder
"lib" and put the iText library
(jar file) into
this
folder.

Create the following class "FirstPdf.java" .
I assume that the
code is
pretty much self-explaining. I tried
to add lots of comments
to make it
easier to understand. For more
complex examples have a look
at the

The resulting pdf should look like the following.
