== Rules of writing regular expressions

The following description is an overview of available meta characters which can be used in regular expressions. 
This chapter is supposed to be a references for the different regex elements.


=== Common matching symbols
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Regular Expression |Description

|`.`
|Matches any character

|`^regex`
|Finds regex that must match at the beginning of the line.

|`regex$`
|Finds regex that must match at the end of the line.

|`[abc]`
|Set definition, can match the letter a or b or c.

|`[abc][vz]`
|Set definition, can match a or b or c followed by
either v
or z.

|`[^abc]`
|
When a caret appears as the first character inside square brackets, it negates the pattern. 
This pattern matches any character except a or b or c.

|`[a-d1-7]`
|Ranges: matches a letter between a and d and figures from 1 to 7, but not d1.

|`X\|Z`
|Finds X or Z.

|`XZ`
|Finds X directly followed by Z.

|`$`
|Checks if a line end follows.

=== Meta characters

The following meta characters have a pre-defined meaning and
make
certain common patterns easier to use, e.g.,
`\d`
instead of
`[0..9]`.


|===
|Regular Expression |Description

|`\d`
|Any digit, short for `[0-9]`

|`\D`
|A non-digit, short for `[^0-9]`

|`\s`
|A whitespace character, short for `[ \t\n\x0b\r\f]`

|`\S`
|A non-whitespace character, short for

|`\w`
|A word character, short for `[a-zA-Z_0-9]`

|`\W`
|A non-word character `[^\w]`

|`\S+`
|Several non-whitespace characters

|`\b`
|Matches a word boundary where a word character is `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`
|===

TIP: These meta characters have the same first letter as
their
representation, e.g., digit,
space, word, and boundary.
Uppercase
symbols define the opposite.

=== Quantifier
A quantifier defines how often an element can occur. The symbols
?, *, + and {} define the quantity of the
regular
expressions


|===
|Regular Expression |Description |Examples

|`*`
|Occurs zero or more times, is short for `{0,}`
|`X*` finds no or several letter X, <sbr /> `.*` finds any character sequence

|`+`
|Occurs one or more times, is short for `{1,}`
|`X+`- Finds one or several letter X

|`?`
|Occurs no or one times, `?` is short for `{0,1}`.
|`X?` finds no or exactly one letter X

|`{X}`
|Occurs X number of times, `{}` describes the order of the preceding liberal
|`\d{3}` searches for three digits, `.{10}` for any character sequence of length 10.

|`{X,Y}`
|Occurs between X and Y times,
|`\d{1,4}` means `\d` must occur at least once and at a maximum of four.

|`*?`
|`?` after a quantifier makes it a _reluctant quantifier_.
It tries to find the smallest match. This makes the regular expression stop at the first match.

=== Grouping and back reference

You can group parts of your regular expression. In your pattern
you
group
elements with round brackets, e.g.,
`()`
.
This allows you to
assign a repetition operator to a complete group.

In addition these groups also create a back reference to the part of
the regular expression. This captures the group.
A back reference
stores the part of the
`String`
which matched the group. This allows you to use this part
in the
replacement.

Via the
`$`
you can
refer to a
group.
`$1`
is the first
group,
`$2`
the
second,
etc.

Let's, for example, assume you want to replace all whitespace
between a letter followed by a point or a comma.
This would involve
that the
point or the comma is part of the pattern. Still it should be
included in the
result.

[source,java]
----
include::res/grouping/whitespace[]
----

This example extracts the text between a title tag.

[source,java]
----
include::res/grouping/extract[]
----

=== Negative look ahead
Negative look ahead provides the possibility to exclude a
pattern.
With this you can say that a string should not
be followed by
another
string.

Negative look ahead are defined via
`(?!pattern)`
. For example, the following will match "a" if "a" is not followed by
"b".

[source,java]
----
include::res/negative/match.txt[]
----

=== Specifying modes inside the regular expression

You can add the mode modifiers to the start of the regex. 
To specify multiple modes, simply put them together as in (?ismx).

* (?i) makes the regex case insensitive.
* (?s) for "single line mode" makes the dot match all characters, including line breaks.
* (?m) for "multi-line mode" makes the caret and dollar match at the start and end of each line in the subject string. 

=== Backslashes in Java

The backslash `\` is an escape character in Java Strings. 
That means backslash has a predefined meaning in Java. 
You have to use double backslash `\\` to define a single backslash.
If you want to define `\w`, then you must be using `\\w` in your regex.
If you want to use backslash as a literal, you have to type `\\\\` as `\` is also an escape character in regular expressions.
