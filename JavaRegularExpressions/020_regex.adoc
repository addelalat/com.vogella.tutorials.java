	<section id="regex_grouping">
		<title>Grouping and back reference
		
			You can group parts of your regular expression. In your pattern
			you
			group
			elements with round brackets, e.g.,
			`()`
			.
			This allows you to
			assign a repetition operator to a complete group.
		

		
			In addition these groups also create a back reference to the part of
			the regular expression. This captures the group.
			A back reference
			stores the part of the
			`String`
			which matched the group. This allows you to use this part
			in the
			replacement.
		

		
			Via the
			`$`
			you can
			refer to a
			group.
			`$1`
			is the first
			group,
			`$2`
			the
			second,
			etc.
		
		 Let's, for example, assume you want to replace all whitespace
			between a letter followed by a point or a comma.
			This would involve
			that the
			point or the comma is part of the pattern. Still it should be
			included in the
			result.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/grouping/whitespace" />

			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="regex_negative">
		<title>Negative look ahead
		Negative look ahead provides the possibility to exclude a
			pattern.
			With this you can say that a string should not
			be followed by
			another
			string.
		
		
			Negative look ahead are defined via
			`(?!pattern)`
			. For example, the following will match "a" if "a" is not followed by
			"b".
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/negative/match.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

	

	<section id="regex_modes">
		<title>Specifying modes inside the regular expression
		
			You can add the mode modifiers to the start of the regex. To specify multiple modes, simply put them
			together as
			in
			(?ismx).
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					(?i) makes the regex case insensitive.
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					(?s) for "single line mode" makes the dot match all characters, including line breaks.
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					(?m) for "multi-line mode" makes the caret and dollar match at the start and end of each line in the subject
						string. 
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		

	
	<section id="regex_backslashes">
		<title>Backslashes in Java
		
			The backslash
			`\`
			is an escape character
			in Java
			Strings. That means
			backslash has a
			predefined meaning in Java. You have to use double
			backslash
			`\\`
			to
			define a single
			backslash.
			If you want to define
			`\w`
			, then you must
			be
			using
			`\\w`
			in
			your regex.
			If you want to use
			backslash as a
			literal,
			you have to type
			`\\\\`
			as
			`\`
			is also an escape
			character in
			regular
			expressions.
