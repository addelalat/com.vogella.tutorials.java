== Processing regular expressions in Eclipse
	
The Eclipse IDE allows to perform search and replace across a set
of
files using regular expressions. In Eclipse use the
kbd:[Ctrl+H]
shortcut to open the
`Search`
dialog.
	
Select the
`File Search`
tab and
check the
`Regular expression`
flag before entering your regular expression. You can also specify the
file type and the scope for the search and replace operation.
	

The following screenshots demonstrate how to search for the '</ulink>'
XML tag with leading whitespace and how to remove the whitespace.

The resulting dialog allows you to review the changes and remove
elements which should not be replaced. If you press
the
`OK`
button, the changes are applied.
