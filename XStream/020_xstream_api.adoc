== XStream - API

The easiest way to serialize java objects with XStream looks like this:

[source, java]
----
YourJavaObject yourJavaObject = // ...

XStream xstream = new XStream();
String yourJavaObjectAsXMLString = xstream.toXML(yourJavaObject);
----

The easiest way to deserialize java objects with XStream looks like this:

[source, java]
----
String xml = // ...

XStream xstream = new XStream();
YourJavaObject yourJavaObject = (YourJavaObject)xstream.fromXML(xml);
----

The `toXML` and `fromXML` methods are overloaded several times. For examples also a file object or a stream can be passed to these methods.

By default the fully qualified name of the objects being serialized is used, which usually leads to a less readable XML output. In order to avoid this the usage of aliases is recommended. See http://x-stream.github.io/alias-tutorial.html[Alias Tutorial] for further information.
