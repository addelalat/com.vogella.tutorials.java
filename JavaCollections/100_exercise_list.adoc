== Exercise: Use Java Collections
	
Create a new Java project called
`com.vogella.java.collections`. 
Also add a package with the same name.
	
Create a Java class called
_Server_
with one String attribute called
`url`.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/example/Server.java[]
----
	
Create getter and setter methods for this attribute using code
generation capabilities of Eclipse. For this select
menu:Source[Generate Getters and Setters]
from the Eclipse menu.
	
Create via Eclipse a constructor which gets a url as parameter. For
this select
menu:Source[Generate Constructor using Fields...]
from the Eclipse menu.
	
Type
`main`
in the class body and use code completion (
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
) to generate a
`main`
method.

In your
`main`
 method create a
`List`
of type
`ArrayList`
and add 3 objects of type
`Server`
objects to this list.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/example/Main.java[]
----
	
Use code completion to create a
_foreach_
loop and write the
`toString`
method to the console. Use code completion based on
`syso`
for that.
	
Run your program.
	
Use Eclipse to create a
`toString`
method based on the
`url`
parameter and re-run your program again.
