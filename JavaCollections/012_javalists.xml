=== The List interface

			The
			`List`
			interface is the base
			interface for collections which allows to store
			objects in a resizable
			container.

=== ArrayList and LinkedList as implementations
		<indexterm>
			<primary>ArrayList</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>LinkedList</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			`ArrayList`
			is an implementation of this interface and allow that elements are
			dynamically added and removed from the list. If more elements are
			added to
			ArrayList than its initial size, its size is increased
			dynamically.
			The elements in an
			`ArrayList`
			can be
			accessed directly and efficiently by using the
			`get()`
			and
			`set()`
			methods, since
			ArrayList
			is implemented based on an array.
			`ArrayList`
			is typically used in implementations as implementation class for the
			`List`
			interface.
		
		
			`LinkedList`
			is implemented as a double linked list. Its
			performance on
			`add()`
			and
			`remove()`
			is better than the performance of Arraylist. The
			`get()`
			and
			`set()`
			methods have worse performance than the ArrayList, as the
			`LinkedList`
			does not provide direct access to its members.
		
		
			The following code demonstrates the usage of
			`List`
			and
			`ArrayList`
			.

=== Sorting lists
		
			You can sort lists using their natural order of via lambdas for
			defining the
			`Comparator.compare()`
			. Typically in Java 8 you use a lambda expression or a method
			reference for the definion of the
			`compare`
			method.

			The
