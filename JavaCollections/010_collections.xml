=== What are collections
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Java Collections</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			The Java language supports arrays to store several objects. An array is
			initialized with an predefined size during
			instantiation. To support more flexible data structures the core Java library provides the
			`collection`
			framework. A
			collection
			is a data structure which
			contains and
			processes a
			set of data.
			The
			data
			stored in the collection is
			encapsulated and
			the access to
			the
			data
			is only
			possible via predefined
			methods. For example the developer can add elements to an collection via a method.
			Collections use internally arrays for there storage but hide the complexity of managing the dynamic size from the developer.
		
		

			For example if your application saves data in an
			object of type
			`People`
			,
			you can store several
			`People`
			objects in a
			collection.
		



[[javacollections_typicaltypes1">
=== Important default implementations
		
			Typical collections are: stacks, queues, deques, lists and
			trees.
		
		
			Java typically provides an interface, like
			`List`
			and one or several implementations for this interface, e.g.,
			the
			`ArrayList`
			class and the
			`LinkedList`
			are implementations of the
			`List`
			interface.
		

[[javacollections_typicaltypes2">
=== Type information with generics
		
			A class or interface whose declaration has one or more type parameters is a generic class or interface.
			For example
			`List`
			defines one type parameter
			`<![CDATA[List<E>]]>`
			.
		
		
			Java collections should get parameterized with an type
			declaration. This enables the Java compiler to check if you try
			to use your collection with the correct type of objects.
			_Generics_
			allow a type or method to operate on objects of
			various
			types while providing compile-time type safety. Before generics
			you had to cast every object you read from a collection and if
			you inserted an object of the wrong type into a collection you would create a runtime exception.
		


[[javacollections_lambdas">
=== Collections and lambdas
		The collection library support lambdas expressions. Operations on collections have been largely simplified with
			this.
		
		
			The following code shows an example how to create a Collection of
			type
			`List`
			which is parameterized with <![CDATA[<String>]]>
			to indicate to the Java compiler that only Strings are allowed in
			this
			list. Is uses a method reference and the
			`foreach`
			loop from Java 8.

		If you try to put an object into this list which is not an object, you would
			receive
			a compiler error.
