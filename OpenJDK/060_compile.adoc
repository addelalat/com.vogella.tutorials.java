== Compile OpenJDK
	
Switch into you OpenJDK directory and compile it via:
	
[source,text]
----
include::res/compile/compile.txt[]
----
	
After a long time the compilation should be successful. The
default output directory is build/platform, where platform your
operating system. The build/platform/j2sdk-image/bin should contain
executables for the OpenJDK tools. The "demo" dirctory contains
several demos which you can use to validate your build. 
Try "./java -version" in your "/build/platform/bin" and validate that you see the version of OpenJDK which you compiled against.
