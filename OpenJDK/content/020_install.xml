== Install Mercurial and Extensions
	
		You first need to make sure Mercurial is installed on your
		system.

		In addition to standard Mercurial
		you also need the Forest Extension.
		These are
		currently not packages for
		Ubuntu, see
		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/174264"> Bug report</ulink>
	

	 You can get the forest extension via the following command. This
		will create the directory hgforest with the file "forest.py". 
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/install/cloneforestextension.txt[]

	Edit the file "~/.hgrc" (i.e. the mercurial configuration file)
		to include the lines.

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/install/includeextension.txt[]

	 After this change you should be able to use commands such
		as
		'fclone' and 'fpull' is you type in "hg" in the command line.

	 Install the build dependencies via the following commands:
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
