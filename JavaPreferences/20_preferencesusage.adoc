[[preferenceusage]]
== Exercise: Using the API

[[preferenceusage1]]
=== Create program
		
`java.util.prefs.Preferences` can be easily used. 
You have to define a node in which the data is stored. 
Then you can call the getter and setter methods. 
The second value is the default value, e.g. if the preference value is not set yet, then this value will be used.
		
Create the following program.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/PreferenceTest.java[]
----

[[preferenceusage2]]
=== Validating
		
Run the program twice. The value of "ID1" should be written with
its default value (true) to the command line, as the preference value
was deleted at the end of the method.
The value
of "ID2" and "ID3"
should have
changed after the first call.
