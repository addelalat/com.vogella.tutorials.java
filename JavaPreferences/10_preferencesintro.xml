== Java Preferences API
	
		The
		_Java Preferences API_
		provides a systematic way to handle
		program preference configurations,
		e.g. to save user
		settings, remember the last value of a field etc.
	
	
		Preferences are key / values pairs where the key is an
		arbitrary
		name for the preference. The value can be a
		boolean, string, int of
		another primitive type. Preferences
		are received and saved by get and
		put methods while the get
		methods also supply a default value in case
		the preferences
		is not yet set.
	
NOTE:

		
			This Java Preferences API is not indented to save
			application
			data, i.e. larger structured data. 
		
	
	
		The Java Preference API removes the burden from the
		individual
		programmer to write code to save
		configuration values on the
		different
		platforms his
		program may be running.
	
	
		The actual storage of the data is dependent on the platform.
