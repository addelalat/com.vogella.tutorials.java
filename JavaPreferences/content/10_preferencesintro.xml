	<para>
		The
		<wordasword>Java Preferences API</wordasword>
		provides a systematic way to handle
		program preference configurations,
		e.g. to save user
		settings, remember the last value of a field etc.
	</para>
	<para>
		Preferences are key / values pairs where the key is an
		arbitrary
		name for the preference. The value can be a
		boolean, string, int of
		another primitive type. Preferences
		are received and saved by get and
		put methods while the get
		methods also supply a default value in case
		the preferences
		is not yet set.
	</para>
	<note>

		<para>
			This Java Preferences API is not indented to save
			application
			data, i.e. larger structured data. 
		</para>
	
	<para>
		The Java Preference API removes the burden from the
		individual
		programmer to write code to save
		configuration values on the
		different
		platforms his
		program may be running.
	</para>
	<para>
		The actual storage of the data is dependent on the platform.
