			<code>java.util.prefs.Preferences</code>
			can be easily used. You have to define a node in which the data
			is
			stored. Then you can call the getter and setter methods. The
			second
			value is the default value, e.g. if the preference value
			is not set
			yet, then this value will be used.

		<para>
			Run the program twice. The value of "ID1" should be written with
			its default value (true) to the command line, as the preference value
			was deleted at the end of the method.
			The value
			of "ID2" and "ID3"
			should have
			changed after the first call.
