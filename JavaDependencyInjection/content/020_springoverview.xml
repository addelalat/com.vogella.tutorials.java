	<para> The Spring Framework is a very comprehensive framework.</para>
	<para> The fundamental functionality provided by the Spring Container
		is dependency injection. Spring provides a light-weight container,
		e.g. the Spring core container, for dependency injection (DI).</para>
	<para> This container allows to inject required objects into other
		objects. This results in a design in which the Java class are not
		hard-coupled. The injection in Spring is either done via setter
		injection of via construction injection.</para>
	<para>These classes which are managed by Spring must conform to
		the JavaBean standard.</para>
	<para>In the context of Spring classes are also referred to as beans
		or as spring beans.</para>

		<para> The core container uses the so-called bean factory to create
