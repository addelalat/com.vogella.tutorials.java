== Using OkHttp for efficient network access
(((OkHttp)))

OkHTTP (http://square.github.io/okhttp/) is an Open Source project designed to be an efficient HTTP client. 
It supports the SPDY protocol. 
SPDY is the basis for HTTP 2.0 and allows multiple HTTP requests to be multiplexed over one socket connection.

If you are using Maven or Gradle as build system you can simply add a
dependency to group ID `com.squareup.okhttp`, artifactId, `okhttp` and the version 2.1.0 (current as of this writing).

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.5.0'
----

NOTE: As of Android 5.0 OkHttp is part of the Android platform and is used for all HTTP calls.
