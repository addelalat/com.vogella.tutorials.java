	<title>Java 8 Date and Time API introduction</title>
	<para> The Java language provides direct support for time-based
		objects. While early versions of Java already had support for Date and Time,
		the Java 8 release contained a new API based on immutable-value classes, which are thread-safe. These classes provide a fluent API for
		construction.

	<para>
		The
		<code>java.time.LocalDate</code>
		and the
		<code>java.time.LocalTime</code>
		classes provide a representation of date and time without timezones. They represent date and time from
		the context of an observer, such as
		a calendar on a desk or a clock on your wall.
	</para>
	<para>
		<code>java.time.LocalDateTime</code>
		represents both a date and a time.
	</para>
	<para>The following code snippet demonstrates the usage these objects.</para>
