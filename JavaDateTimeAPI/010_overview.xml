== Java 8 Date and Time API introduction
	 The Java language provides direct support for time-based
		objects. While early versions of Java already had support for Date and Time,
		the Java 8 release contained a new API based on immutable-value classes, which are thread-safe. These classes provide a fluent API for
		construction.
	
	
		The
		`java.time.LocalDate`
		and the
		`java.time.LocalTime`
		classes provide a representation of date and time without timezones. They represent date and time from
		the context of an observer, such as
		a calendar on a desk or a clock on your wall.
	
	
		`java.time.LocalDateTime`
		represents both a date and a time.
	
	The following code snippet demonstrates the usage these objects.

		The
		`java.time.Duration`
		class can be used to describe durations.
