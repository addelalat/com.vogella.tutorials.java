[[formatdata">
== Parsing and formatting Dates and Times
	
		To Date and Time classes of Java 8 provide a
		`parse`
		method for parsing a String that contains date and time information.
		They also provide the
		`format`
		method for formating Date and Time objects for output.

	
	
		In both cases you create an instance of
		`DateTimeFormatter`
		which is passed to the
		`parse`
		or
		`format`
		method.
