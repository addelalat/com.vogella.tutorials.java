== List
	
		The following example is contained in the project
		called
		<wordasword>de.vogella.datastructures.list</wordasword>
		.
	
	
		A
		<wordasword>List</wordasword>
		represents a data structure which allows to dynamically
		add, access and
		remove objects of the same type. Adding objects to the
		list is usually
		done via
		the
		`add()`
		method. The
		`get(int i)`
		method allows
		to retrieve the
		element
		at
		position i.

	 The following show contains a small JUnit test for the data
		structure. I use in the
		first test the MyList implementation and in the
		second test the
		standard Java List implementation.

		<tip>
			You typically also have the
			`remove(int i)`
			method to remove the
			element at position i but I leave this
			implementation for the reader.
			To delete elements in your list just
			shift all elements after
			position i one position to the left and
			decrease size.
