[[list]]
== List

The following example is contained in the project called _de.vogella.datastructures.list_.

A _List_
represents a data structure which allows to dynamically
add, access and
remove objects of the same type. Adding objects to the
list is usually
done via
the
`add()`
method. The
`get(int i)`
method allows
to retrieve the
element
at
position i.

[source,java]
----
include::res/list/MyList.java[]

The following show contains a small JUnit test for the data
structure. I use in the
first test the MyList implementation and in the
second test the
standard Java List implementation.

TIP: You typically also have the
`remove(int i)`
method to remove the
element at position i but I leave this
implementation for the reader.
To delete elements in your list just
shift all elements after
position i one position to the left and
decrease size.
