		_EasyMock_
		is a mock framework which can be easily used
		in
		conjunction with
		JUnit.
		The following description demonstrates the
		usage of
		EasyMock.
	
	EasyMock instantiates an object based on an interface or class.

		The
		`createNiceMock()`
		method creates a mock which returns default values for methods which
		are not overiden. A mock created with the
		`Mock()`
		method will fails in such a case.
	


	
		EasyMock has several methods which are used to configure the Mock
		object.
		The
		`expect()`
		method tells EasyMock to simulate a method
		with certain
		arguments. The
		`andReturn()`
		method
		defines the return value of this
		method for the specified method
		parameters. The
		`times()`
		method defines how often the Mock object will be
		called.
	
	
		The
		`replay()`
		method is called to make the Mock object
		available.
