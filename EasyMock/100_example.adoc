== Tutorial: Using Easy Mock and JUnit
[[tutorial_easymockproject]]
=== Create project and classes
		
Create a new Java Project called
_com.vogella.testing.easymock.first_
. Create the
following
classes.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/easymock/Position.java[]
----
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/easymock/ICalcMethod.java[]
----
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/easymock/IncomeCalculator.java[]
----
		
The
`IncomeCalculator`
class should be
tested. The
class has the
purpose to calculate the
salary of a person based on
the provided
method and
position. Obviously
the
test depends
on the
provided methods.

[[tutorial_easymocktest]]
=== Create tests
		
Create a new
`test`
source folder in your project.
		
Create a new test for
`IncomeCalculator`
and place the new test class in this
folder.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/easymock/IncomeCalculatorTest.java[]
----
		
After execution of the test you can call the
`verify`
method to
check if the mock object was called as defined.
