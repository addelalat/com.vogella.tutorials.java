=== Create project and classes
		
			Create a new Java Project called
			_com.vogella.testing.easymock.first_
			. Create the
			following
			classes.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/easymock/Position.java[]
----
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/easymock/ICalcMethod.java[]
----
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/easymock/IncomeCalculator.java[]
----
		
		
			The
			`IncomeCalculator`
			class should be
			tested. The
			class has the
			purpose to calculate the
			salary of a person based on
			the provided
			method and
			position. Obviously
			the
			test depends
			on the
			provided methods.
		

	<section id="tutorial_easymocktest">
=== Create tests

		
			Create a new
			`test`
			source folder in your project.
		
		
			Create a new test for
			`IncomeCalculator`
			and place the new test class in this
			folder.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/easymock/IncomeCalculatorTest.java[]
----
		

		
			After execution of the test you can call the
			`verify`
			method to
			check if the mock object was called as defined.
