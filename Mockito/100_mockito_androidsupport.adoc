Using Mockito on Android
	
Mockito can also be directly used in Android unit tests  by adding the dependency to it to the Gradle build file.
To use it in instrumented Android tests (since the release 1.9.5). 
Which requires that dexmaker and dexmaker-mockito are also added as dependency in the Gradle build file.
