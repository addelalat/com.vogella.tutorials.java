		<title>Processes and Threads
		
			A Java program runs in its own process and by default in one
			thread.
			Java supports threads as part of the Java language via the
			`Thread`
			code.
			The Java application can create new threads via this class.
		
		
			Java 1.5
			also
			provides improved support for concurrency with the in the
			`java.util.concurrent`
			package.

		<title>Locks and thread synchronization
		
			Java provides
			_locks_
			to protect certain parts of the code to be executed by
			several
			threads at the same time. The simplest way of
			locking a certain method
			or Java class is to define the method or class with the
			`synchronized`
			keyword.
		
		
			The
			_synchronized_
			keyword in Java ensures:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					that only a single thread can execute a block of code at
						the
						same time
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					that each thread entering a synchronized block
						of code
						sees the
						effects of all previous modifications that were
						guarded by
						the same
						lock
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			Synchronization is necessary for mutually
				exclusive access to
				blocks of and for reliable communication
				between threads.
			
		

		
			You can use the
			_synchronized_
			keyword for the definition of a
			method. This would
			ensure that only one
			thread can enter this
			method at the same time. Another threads which
			is
			calling this method would wait until the first threads leaves this
			method.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/synchronized/Method.java" />
			</programlisting>
		


		
			You can also use the
			`synchronized`
			keyword to protect blocks of code within a method. This block is
			guarded by a key,
			which can be either a
			string
			or an object. This key is
			called the
			_lock_.

			All code
			which
			is protected by
			the same lock
			can only
			be executed
			by one
			thread at the same time
		


		
			For example the following datastructure will ensure that only
			one
			thread can access the inner block of the
			`add()`
			and
			`next()`
			methods.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/synchronized/CrawledSites.java" />
			</programlisting>

		<title>Volatile
		
			If a variable is declared with the
			_volatile_
			keyword then it is guaranteed that
			any
			thread that reads the field will
			see the most recently written
			value.
			The
			_volatile_
			keyword will not perform any mutual exclusive
			lock on the variable.
		
		
			As of Java 5 write access to a
			_volatile_
			variable will also
			update non-volatile variables which were modified
			by the same thread.
			This can also be used to update values within a
			reference variable,
			e.g. for a
			_volatile_
			variable person. In this case
			you must use a
			temporary variable person
			and use the setter to
			initialize the
			variable and then assign the
			temporary variable to the
			final
			variable. This will then make the
			address changes of this
			variable
			and the values visible to other
			threads.
