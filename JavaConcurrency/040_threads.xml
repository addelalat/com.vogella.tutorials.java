	<title>Threads in Java</title>
	<para>
		The base means for concurrency are is the
		<code>java.lang.Threads</code>
		class. A
		<code>Thread</code>
		executes an object of type
		<code>java.lang.Runnable</code>
		.
	</para>
	<para>
		<code>Runnable</code>
		is an interface with defines the
		<code>run()</code>
		method. This
		method
		is called by the
		<code>Thread</code>
		object and contains the work which
		should
		be done.
		Therefore the
		"Runnable" is the task to perform. The
		Thread is the
		worker who is doing
		this task.
	</para>
	<para>
		The following demonstrates a task (Runnable) which counts the
		sum
		of a
		given range of numbers. Create a new Java project called
		<code>de.vogella.concurrency.threads</code>
		for the
		example code of this
		section.

		The following example demonstrate the usage of the
		<code>Thread</code>
		and the
		<code>Runnable</code>
		class.

	<para>
		Using the
		<code>Thread</code>
		class
		directly has the following disadvantages.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Creating a new thread causes some performance overhead
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Too many threads can lead to reduced performance, as the
					CPU
					needs to switch between these threads.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>You cannot easily control the number of threads, therefore
					you
					may run into out of memory errors due to too many threads.
				</para>
			</listitem>

	</para>
	<para>
		The
		<code>java.util.concurrent</code>
		package offers improved support for
		concurrency compared to the direct
		usage of
		<code>Threads</code>
		. This package is described in the next section.
