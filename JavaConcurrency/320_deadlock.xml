	<title>Deadlock
	
		A concurrent application has the risk of a
		_deadlock_
		. A set of processes are deadlocked if all processes are waiting for
		an
		event which another process in the same set has to cause.
	
	 For example if thread A waits for a lock on object Z which
		thread B holds and thread B wait for a look on object Y which is hold
		be process A then these two processes are locked and cannot continue
		in their processing.
	
	This can be compared to a traffic jam, where cars(threads)
		require the access to a certain street(resource), which is
		currently blocked by another car(lock).
