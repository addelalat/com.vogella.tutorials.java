	<title>Threads pools with the Executor Framework
	
		<tip>
			You find this examples in the source section in Java project called
			_de.vogella.concurrency.threadpools_
			.

	 Thread pools manage a pool of worker threads. The thread pools
		contains a work queue which holds tasks waiting to get executed.
	
	
		A thread pool can be described as a collection of
		`Runnable`
		objects

		(work queue) and a connections of running threads. These
		threads are
		constantly running and are checking the work query for new
		work. If
		there is new work to be done they execute this Runnable. The
		Thread
		class itself provides a method, e.g. execute(Runnable r) to add
		a new
		`Runnable`
		object to the work queue.
	
	 The Executor framework provides example implementation of the
		java.util.concurrent.Executor interface, e.g.
		Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int n) which will create n worker
		threads. The ExecutorService adds life cycle methods to the Executor,
		which allows to shutdown the Executor and to wait for termination.
	
	
		<tip>
			If you want to use one thread pool with one thread which
			executes
			several runnables you can use
			the
			`Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`
			method.
		</tip>
	
	 Create again the Runnable.

			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

	Now you run your runnables with the executor framework.
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/threadpools/Main.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		In case the threads should return some value (result-bearing
		threads)
		then you can use the
		`java.util.concurrent.Callable`
		class.
