== Fork-Join in Java 7
	
Java 7 introduce a new parallel mechanism for compute intensive
tasks, the fork-join framework. The fork-join framework allows you to
distribute a certain task on several workers and then wait for the
result.
	
For Java 6.0 you can download the package (jsr166y) from the
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html[Download site].
	
For testing create the Java project
"de.vogella.performance.forkjoin".
If you are not using Java 7 you
also need to
_jsr166y.jar_
to the classpath.
	
Create first a
`algorithm`
package and then the following class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/forkjoin/Problem.java[]
----	
	
Define now the
`Solver`
class as shown in the following example coding.
	
	
TIP: The API defines other top classes, e.g. RecursiveAction, AsyncAction. 
Check the Javadoc for details.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/forkjoin/Solver.java[]
----
	
Now define a small test class for testing it efficiency.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/forkjoin/Test.java[]
