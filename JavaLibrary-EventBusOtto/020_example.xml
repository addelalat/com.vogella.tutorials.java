== Exercise: Using Otto the event bus system

	
		This is an example for the usage of Otto in an Android
		application
		but this library can also be used in standard Java
		applications.
	
	
		Create a new Android project called
		`com.vogella.java.library.otto`
		based on the
		`Blank Activity with Fragment`
		template.
	

	In case you are using the Eclipse IDE, download the Otto JAR and
		add them to the
		build path of your
		project.
	
	
		For Gradle users simply add the dependency to the
		`build.gradle`
		file.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/build.gradle[]
----
	
	
		The
		`activity_main.xml`
		layout file of the activity should look like the following.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/activity_main.xml[]
----
	

	
		The
		`fragment_main.xml`
		layout file of the fragment should look like the following.
	


	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/fragment_main.xml[]
----
	
	
		Add an fragment and add it dynamically to your activity.
		Send
		an event
		from the fragment to the activity and vice versa.
		Display in
		both case a
		`Toast`
		.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/MainActivity.java[]
----
	
	<note>
		
			The example is intentional simple. In a real Android application
			you
			would created the
			`Bus`
			singleton in the
			`Application`
			class and the fragment would be in its own file.
