		<title>Otto as event bus system </title>
		<para>
			<ulink url="http://square.github.io/otto/">Otto</ulink>
			is an Open Source project designed to provide an event bus
			implementation so that components can publish and subscribe
			to
			events.
		</para>
		<para>
			Otto has been a fork of the
			<wordasword>Guava</wordasword>
			event bus library from Google and been redesigned to support Android
			as well as possible. Unlike the Guava event bus,
			Otto does not
			consider event subscriptions from base classes or interfaces to
			improve performance of the library and to
			keep the application code
			simple and unambiguous.

			The usage of this library in Java or Android is very simple, download

		<note>
			<para>The following description assumes your are using Otto in an
				Android application, even though it is possible to
				use it in an standard Java application.
			</para>
		
		<para>
			To use Otto, create a singleton instance of the
			<code>Bus</code>
			class
			and provide access to it for your Android components. This is
			typically done in the
			<code>Application</code>
			object of your Android application.

		</para>
		<para>
			In this example the
			<code>ThreadEnforcer.MAIN</code>
			parameter is used, in this case Otto enforces that events are only
			send from the
			main thread. If you want to be able to
			send events from
			any thread use the
			<code>ThreadEnforcer.ANY</code>
			parameter.
