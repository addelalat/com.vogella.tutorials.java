== MySQL JDBC driver
	
To connect to MySQL from Java, you have to use the JDBC driver from MySQL. 
The MySQL JDBC driver is called _MySQL Connector/J_. 
You find the latest MySQL JDBC driver under the following URL: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j.
	
The download contains a `JAR` file which we require later.
