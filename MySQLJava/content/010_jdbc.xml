== Connection to database with Java
	
		The interface for accessing relational databases from Java is
		_Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)_
		. Via JDBC you create a connection to the database, issue database
		queries and update as well as receive the results.
	

	
		JDBC provides an interface which allows you to perform SQL
		operations independently of the instance of the used database. To use
		JDBC, you require the database specific implementation of the
		JDBC
		driver.
