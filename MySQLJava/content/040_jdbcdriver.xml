== MySQL JDBC driver
	
		To connect to MySQL from Java, you have to use the JDBC driver
		from
		MySQL. The MySQL JDBC driver is called
		<wordasword>MySQL Connector/J</wordasword>
		. You find the latest MySQL JDBC driver under the following URL:
		http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j</ulink>
		.
	

	
		The download contains a
		`JAR`
		file which we require later.
