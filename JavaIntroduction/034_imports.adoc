[[javaimports]]
== Import statements
[[javaimports_definition]]
=== Usage of import statements
		
You have to access a Java class always via its full-qualified name, i.e., the package name plus a . followed by the class name.
		
You can add `import` statements into your class file.
These allow you to use the related classes in your code without the package qualifier.


[[javaimport_staticimports]]
=== Static imports
		
Static import allows `public static` members (fields and methods) of another class to be used in Java code without a class reference.
		
The feature provides a typesafe mechanism to include constants into code.
It also improves code readability and allows Java API designers to write a concise API.
