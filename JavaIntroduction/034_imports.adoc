=== Usage of import statements
		
In Java you have to access a class always via its
full-qualified name, i.e., the package name and the class name.
		
You can add
`import`
statements for classes or packages into your class file, which allow
you to use the related classes in your code without the package
qualifier.


[[javaimport_staticimports]]
=== Static imports
		
Static import is a feature that allows members (fields and
methods)
which are defined in a class
with the
`public static`
access modifier
to be used in Java code
without specifying the class
in
which the member
is defined.
		
The feature
provides a typesafe mechanism to
include constants
into code
without
having to reference the class that
originally defined
the
field.
