=== A small history of Java
		
			Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from
			Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. The target of Java is to
			write a program once and then run
			this
			program on multiple operating systems. The first publicly
			available version
			of
			Java
			(Java 1.0) was released in 1995. Sun Microsystems was
			acquired by the Oracle
			Corporation in
			2010.
			Oracle has now the
			steermanship for Java. In 2006 Sun started to make Java available under the GNU General
			Public License (GPL). Oracle
			continues this project
			called
			<wordasword>OpenJDK</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			Over time new enhanced versions of Java have been
			released.
			The current
			version of Java is Java 1.8 which is also known
			as
			<wordasword>Java 8</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			Java is defined by a specification and consists of a programming language, a compiler, core libraries and a runtime
			(Java virtual machine)
			The Java runtime allows
			software
			developers to write program
			code in
			other
			languages than
			the Java
			programming
			language
			which still runs
			on
			the
			Java
			virtual
			machine. The
			<wordasword>Java platform</wordasword>
			is usually associated with the
			<wordasword>Java virtual machine</wordasword>
			and the
			<wordasword>Java core libraries</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			The Java language was designed with the following properties:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Platform independent: Java programs use the Java virtual
						machine
						as
						abstraction and do not access the operating
						system
						directly. This makes Java programs highly portable. A Java
						program
						(which is standard-compliant and follows
						certain rules) can
						run
						unmodified on all supported platforms, e.g., Windows or Linux.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Object-orientated programming language:
						Except the primitive
						data types, all elements in Java are objects.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Strongly-typed programming language: Java is
						strongly-typed,
						e.g., the types of the used variables must be
						pre-defined and
						conversion to
						other objects is relatively strict, e.g., must be done
						in most cases by the programmer.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Interpreted and compiled language: Java source
						code is
						transferred into the bytecode format which does not
						depend on the
						target
						platform. These bytecode instructions will be interpreted by
						the Java
						Virtual
						machine (JVM). The
						JVM contains a so called
						Hotspot-Compiler which
						translates performance critical bytecode
						instructions
						into native
						code
						instructions.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Automatic memory management: Java manages the memory
						allocation and de-allocation for creating new objects.
						The
						program
						does not have direct access to the memory. The so-called garbage
						collector automatically deletes objects
						to which no active pointer
						exists.
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		
			The Java syntax is similar to C++. Java is case-sensitive,
			e.g.,
			variables called
			`myValue`
			and
			`myvalue`
			are treated as different
			variables.

=== Java virtual machine
		
			The Java
			virtual
			machine (JVM) is a software implementation of a
			computer that
			executes programs like a real
			machine.
		
		
			The Java virtual machine is written specifically for a
			specific
			operating system, e.g., for Linux a special
			implementation is required
			as well as for Windows.

			Java programs are compiled by the Java compiler into
			<wordasword>bytecode</wordasword>
			.
			The Java virtual machine interprets this
			<wordasword>bytecode</wordasword>
			and
			executes
			the Java program.
		



	<section id="javaoverview_jrejdk">
=== Java Runtime Environment vs. Java Development Kit
		
			A Java distribution typically comes in two flavors, the
			<wordasword>Java Runtime Environment</wordasword>
			(JRE)
			and the
			<wordasword>Java Development Kit</wordasword>
			(JDK).
		
		
			The JRE consists of the JVM and the
			Java class libraries. Those contain the
			necessary
			functionality to start
			Java
			programs.
		
		
			The JDK additionally contains
			the development tools necessary to
			create Java programs. The JDK therefore consists
			of a
			Java compiler,
			the
			Java
			virtual machine and the Java class libraries.
		


	<section id="javadevelopmend">
=== Development Process with Java
		
			Java source files are written as plain text documents.
			The programmer
			typically writes Java source code in an
			<wordasword>Integrated Development Environment</wordasword>
			(IDE) for
			programming. An IDE supports the programmer in the task of
			writing code, e.g.,
			it provides auto-formating of
			the source code,
			highlighting of the
			important keywords, etc.
		
		
			At some point the programmer (or the IDE) calls the Java
			compiler
			(
			`javac`
			).
			The Java compiler creates the
			<wordasword>bytecode</wordasword>
			instructions.
			These instructions are
			stored in
			`.class`
			files and can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine.
		


	<section id="java_garbagecollector">
=== Garbage collector
		
			The JVM automatically re-collects the memory which is not
			referred to
			by other objects.
			The Java
			<wordasword>garbage collector</wordasword>
			checks all object references and finds the objects which can be
			automatically released.
		
		
			While the garbage collector relieves the programmer from the
			need to
			explicitly manage memory, the programmer still
			need to ensure
			that he
			does not keep unneeded object references, otherwise the
			garbage
			collector cannot release the
			associated memory. Keeping unneeded
			object references are typically called
			<wordasword>memory leaks</wordasword>
			.
		

	<section id="java_classpath">
=== Classpath
		
			The
			<wordasword>classpath</wordasword>
			defines where the Java compiler and Java runtime look
			for
			`.class`
			files to
			load. These instructions can be used in the Java program.
		
		
			For
			example, if you want to use an external Java
			library
			you have to
			add
			this
			library to your classpath to use it in
			your
			program.
