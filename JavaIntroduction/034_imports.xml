		<title>Usage of import statements</title>
		<para>
			In Java you have to access a class always via its
			full-qualified name, i.e., the package name and the class name.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can add
			<code>import</code>
			statements for classes or packages into your class file, which allow
			you to use the related classes in your code without the package
			qualifier.

		<title>Static imports</title>
		<para>
			Static import is a feature that allows members (fields and
			methods)
			which are defined in a class
			with the
			<code>public static</code>
			access modifier
			to be used in Java code
			without specifying the class
			in
			which the member
			is defined.
		</para>
		<para>
			The feature
			provides a typesafe mechanism to
			include constants
			into code
			without
			having to reference the class that
			originally defined
			the
			field.
		</para>
