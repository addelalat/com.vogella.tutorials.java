== Exercise: Write, compile and run a Java program
	<section id="firstjava_source">
=== Write source code
		
			The following Java program is developed under Linux using a text
			editor and the command line.
			The
			process on other operating system
			should be similar, but
			is not
			covered
			in this description.
		
		
			Select or create a new directory which will be used for your Java
			development. In this description the path
			<filename class="directory">\home\vogella\javastarter`
			is used. On Microsoft Windows
			you might want to use
			<filename class="directory">c:\temp\javastarter`.
			This path is
			called
			<wordasword>javadir</wordasword>
			in the following description.
		
		
			Open a text editor which supports plain text, e.g.,
			<wordasword>gedit</wordasword>
			under Linux or
			<wordasword>Notepad</wordasword>
			under Windows
			and write the following source code.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java[]
----
		
		<warning>
			
				Do not use a rich editor like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice for
				writing Java code. If in doubt, google for "Plain text editor for
				[your_OS]".

			Save the source code in your
			<wordasword>javadir</wordasword>
			directory with the
			`HelloWorld.java`
			filename. The name of a Java source
			file must always equal
			the class
			name (within the source code)
			and end
			with the
			`.java`
			extension. In this example
			the
			filename must be
			`HelloWorld.java`,
			because
			the
			class is called
			`HelloWorld`.
		

	<section id="firstjava_compile">
=== Compile and run your Java program
		
			Open a shell for command line access.
		
		<tip>
			
				If you don't know how to do this, google for "How to open a
				shell under [your_OS]".
			
		
		
			Switch to the
			<wordasword>javadir</wordasword>
			directory with the command
			`cd javadir`,
			for
			example, in the above example
			via the
			`
				cd \home\vogella\javastarter
			`
			command.
			Use the
			`ls`
			command (`dir`
			under Microsoft Windows) to verify
			that
			the source file is in the
			directory.
		
		
			Compile your Java source file into a class file with the
			following command.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/helloworld/compile.sh[]
----
		
		
			Afterwards list again the content of the directory with the
			`ls`
			or
			`dir`
			command. The
			directory contains now a file
			`HelloWorld.class`. If you
			see
			this
			file, you have successfully compiled your first Java source
			code
			into
			bytecode.
		
		<tip>
			
				By default, the compiler puts each class file in the same
				directory as its source file. You can specify a separate destination
				directory with the `-d` compiler flag.
			
		
		
			You can now start your compiled Java program. Ensure that you are
			still in the
			<wordasword>jardir</wordasword>
			directory and enter the following command to start your Java program.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/helloworld/run.sh[]
----
		
		
			The system should write "Hello World" on the command line.

	<section id="firstjava_classpath">
=== Using the classpath
		
			You can use the classpath to run the program from another place
			in your directory.
		
		
			Switch to the command line, e.g., under
menu:Windows Start[Run]
			`cmd`.
			Switch to any directory you want. Type:
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/helloworld/run.sh[]
----
		
		
			If you are not in the directory in which the compiled class is stored,
			then the system will show an error message:
			<command>
				Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
				test/TestClass
			</command>
		
		
			To use the class, type the following command. Replace
			"mydirectory" with the directory which contains the test
			directory.
			You should again see the "HelloWorld" output.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/helloworld/classpath.sh[]
