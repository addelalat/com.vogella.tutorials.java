== Base Java language structure

=== Class

A class is a template that describes the data and behavior
associated with an instance of that class.

A class is
defined by the
_class_
keyword and must start with a capital letter. The body of a class is
surrounded by {}.

include::res/statements/MyClass.java[]
----

The data associated with a class is stored in
_variables_
;
the
behavior associated to a class or object is implemented
with
_methods_
.

A class is contained in a text file with the same name as
the
class plus the
`.java`
extension. It is also possible to define inner classes, these are classes defined within another class, in this case
you do not need a separate file for this class.

=== Object

An object is an instance of a class.

The object is the real element which
has
data and can perform
actions. Each object is created based on the class
definition. The class can be seen as the blueprint of an object, i.e., it
describes how an object is created.

=== Package

Java groups classes into functional
_packages_
.

Packages are typically used to group
classes into logical
units.
For
example, all graphical views of an application might
be placed in
the
same package called
`com.vogella.webapplication.views`
.

It is
common practice to use the
reverse
domain name of the company as
top
level package. For example,
the
company might own
the domain,
vogella.com and in this example
the
Java
packages of this company starts
with
`com.vogella`
.

Other main reason for the usage of packages is to avoid name
collisions of classes.
A
name collision occurs if two
programmers give
the same
_fully qualified name_
to a class. The
_fully qualified name_
of a class in Java consists of the package name followed by a
dot
(.)
and the class name.

Without packages, a programmer
may
create a Java class
called
`Test`
.
Another programmer may create
a class with the same name. With
the
usage of packages you can
tell the system which class
to call.
For
example, if the first programmer puts
the
`Test`
class into package
`report`
and the second programmer
puts his class into package
`xmlreader`
you can distinguish between these classes by using the
_fully qualified name_
,
e.g,
`xmlreader.Test`
or
`report.Test`
.

[[javadef_inheritance]]
=== Inheritance

A class can be derived from another class. In this case this
class is
called a
_subclass_
.
Another common phrase is that
_a class extends another class._

The class
from which the subclass is derived is called a
_superclass_
.

Inheritance allows a class to inherit the behavior and data
definitions of another class. 

The following codes demonstrates how a class can extend another
class. In Java a class can only extend a maximum
of one class.

[[javadef_objectsuperclass]]
=== Object as superclass

Every object in Java implicitly extends the
`Object`
class. The class defines the following methods for every Java
object:
* `equals(o1)` allows checking if the current object is equal to o1

* `getClass()` returns the class of the object

* `hashCode()` returns an identifier of the current object

* `toString()` gives a string representation of the current object

=== Exception handling in Java

In Java an exception is an event to indicate an error during
the
runtime of an application. So this disrupts the
usual flow of the
application's instructions.

In general exceptions are thrown up in the call hierarchy until
they get catched.

=== Checked Exceptions

Checked Exceptions are explicitly thrown by methods,
which might
cause the exception or re-thrown by methods in
case
a thrown
Exception is not caught.

So when calling methods, which throw checked Exceptions the
Exceptions have either to be caught or to be
re-thrown.

[source,java]
-----
include::res/exceptions/CatchException.java[]
----

Checked Exceptions are used when an error can be predicted
under certain circumstances, e.g., a file which
cannot be found.

=== Runtime Exceptions

Runtime Exceptions are Exceptions, which are not explicitly
mentioned in the method signature and therefore also
do not have to
be catched explicitly.

The most famous runtime exception is the NullPointerException, which
occurs during runtime, when a method is invoked
on an object, which
actually is
`null`
.
