=== Check installation
		
			To run Java programs on your computer you must at least have the Java
			runtime environment (JRE) installed. This might already be the case
			on your machine.
			You can test
			is the JRE is installed and in your
			current path by
			opening a console
			(if you are using
			Windows: Win+R,
			enter
			<guilabel>cmd</guilabel>
			and press Enter) and by typing in the
			following command:
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/install/javaversion.sh" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			If the JRE is installed and within your path, this commands
			print
			information about your Java installation. In this case you can skip
			the Java installation description. You may want to note down if you
			have a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Java, see
			<xref linkend="java_installation_32or64" />
			.
			
			
			If the command line
			returns
			the
			information that the program could not
			be
			found,
			you
			have to
			install
			Java.
