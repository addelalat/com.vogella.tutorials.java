== Cheat Sheets

During your Java development time, you will be asked to do certain things, like creating a local variable.
The following can be used as a reference for such tasks, so that you how what you have to do.

[[cheatsheets_class]]
=== Working with classes

While programming Java you have to create several classes, methods, instance variables. 
The following uses the package test.

.Table Title
|===

|What to do |How to do it

|Create a new class called _MyNewClass_.
a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass1.java[]

|Create a new attribute (instance variable) called _var1_ of type `String` in the `MyNewClass` class

a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass2.java[]

|Create a Constructor for your
`MyNewClass`
class which has a
`String`
parameter and assigns the value of it to
the
`var1`
instance
variable.
a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass3.java[]

|Create a new method called
_doSomeThing_
in your class which does not
return a value and has no parameters.

a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass3a.java[]

|Create a new method called
_doSomeThing2_
in your class which does
not
return a value and has two parameters,
an `int`
and a `Person`

a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass4.java[]

|Create a new method called
_doSomeThing3_
in your class which
returns an `int` value and has three parameters,
two `Strings` and a `Person`.

a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyNewClass5.java[]

|Create a class called _MyOtherClass_ with two instance
variables.
One will store a `String`, the other will store a `Dog`.
Create
getter and setter for these variables.

a|
include::res/cheatsheets/MyOtherClass.java[]

[[cheatsheets_localvariable]]
=== Working with local variable

A local variable must always be declared in a method.

.Table Title
|===
|What to do |How to do it

|Declare a (local) variable of type `String`.
|`String variable1;`

|Declare a (local) variable of type `String` and
assign
`"Test"`
to it.
|`String variable2 = "Test";`

|Declare a (local) variable of type `Person`
|`Person person;`

|Declare a (local) variable of type `Person`,
create a new Object and assign the variable to this object.
|`Person person = new Person();`

|Declare an array of type `String`
|`String array[];`

|Declare an array of type `Person` and create an array
for this
variable which can hold 5 persons.
|`Person array[]= new Person[5];`

|Assign 5 to the `int` variable `var1`
(which was already declared);
|`var1 = 5;`

|Assign the existing variable `pers2` to the existing
variable
`pers1`;
|`pers1 = pers2;`

|Declare an `ArrayList` variable which can hold objects
of type
`Person`
|`ArrayList<Person> persons`

|Create a new `ArrayList`
with objects of type `Person`
and
assign it to the existing variable `persons`.
|`persons = new ArrayList<Person>();`

|Declare an `ArrayList` variable which can hold objects of type `Person` and create a new `Object` for it.
|`ArrayList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<Person>();`
