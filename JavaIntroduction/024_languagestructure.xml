== Base Java language structure

	<section id="javadef_class">
=== Class
		
			A class is a template that describes the data and behavior
			associated with an instance of that class.
		
		
			A class is
			defined by the
			<wordasword>class</wordasword>
			keyword and must start with a capital letter. The body of a class is
			surrounded by {}.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/statements/MyClass.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The data associated with a class is stored in
			<wordasword>variables</wordasword>
			;
			the
			behavior associated to a class or object is implemented
			with
			<wordasword>methods</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			A class is contained in a text file with the same name as
			the
			class plus the
			`.java`
			extension. It is also possible to define inner classes, these are classes defined within another class, in this case
			you do not need a separate file for this class.
		
	</section>

	<section id="javadef_object">
=== Object
		An object is an instance of a class.
		
			The object is the real element which
			has
			data and can perform
			actions. Each object is created based on the class
			definition. The class can be seen as the blueprint of an object, i.e., it
			describes how an object is created.
		
	</section>


	<section id="javadef_package">
=== Package
		
			Java groups classes into functional
			<wordasword>packages</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			Packages are typically used to group
			classes into logical
			units.
			For
			example, all graphical views of an application might
			be placed in
			the
			same package called
			`com.vogella.webapplication.views`
			.
		
		
			It is
			common practice to use the
			reverse
			domain name of the company as
			top
			level package. For example,
			the
			company might own
			the domain,
			vogella.com and in this example
			the
			Java
			packages of this company starts
			with
			`com.vogella`
			.
		
		
			Other main reason for the usage of packages is to avoid name
			collisions of classes.
			A
			name collision occurs if two
			programmers give
			the same
			<wordasword>fully qualified name</wordasword>
			to a class. The
			<wordasword>fully qualified name</wordasword>
			of a class in Java consists of the package name followed by a
			dot
			(.)
			and the class name.
		
		
			Without packages, a programmer
			may
			create a Java class
			called
			`Test`
			.
			Another programmer may create
			a class with the same name. With
			the
			usage of packages you can
			tell the system which class
			to call.
			For
			example, if the first programmer puts
			the
			`Test`
			class into package
			`report`
			and the second programmer
			puts his class into package
			`xmlreader`
			you can distinguish between these classes by using the
			<wordasword>fully qualified name</wordasword>
			,
			e.g,
			`xmlreader.Test`
			or
			`report.Test`
			.

	<section id="javadef_inheritance">
=== Inheritance
		
			A class can be derived from another class. In this case this
			class is
			called a
			<wordasword>subclass</wordasword>
			.
			Another common phrase is that
			<wordasword>a class extends another class.</wordasword>
		
		
			The class
			from which the subclass is derived is called a
			<wordasword>superclass</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			Inheritance allows a class to inherit the behavior and data
			definitions of another class. 
			
		
		
			The following codes demonstrates how a class can extend another
			class. In Java a class can only extend a maximum
			of one class.

	<section id="javadef_objectsuperclass">
=== Object as superclass
		
			Every object in Java implicitly extends the
			`Object`
			class. The class defines the following methods for every Java
			object:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					
						`equals(o1)`
						allows checking if the current object is equal to o1
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						`getClass()`
						returns the class of the object
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						`hashCode()`
						returns an identifier of the current object
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						`toString()`
						gives a string representation of the current object
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

=== Exception handling in Java
		In Java an exception is an event to indicate an error during
			the
			runtime of an application. So this disrupts the
			usual flow of the
			application's instructions.
		
		
			In general exceptions are thrown up in the call hierarchy until
			they get catched.

		<section>
	=== Checked Exceptions
			Checked Exceptions are explicitly thrown by methods,
				which might
				cause the exception or re-thrown by methods in
				case
				a thrown
				Exception is not caught.
			
			So when calling methods, which throw checked Exceptions the
				Exceptions have either to be caught or to be
				re-thrown.
			
			
				<programlisting language="java">
					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/exceptions/CatchException.java" />
				</programlisting>
			
			
				Checked Exceptions are used when an error can be predicted
				under certain circumstances, e.g., a file which
				cannot be found.
			
		</section>
		<section>
	=== Runtime Exceptions
			
				Runtime Exceptions are Exceptions, which are not explicitly
				mentioned in the method signature and therefore also
				do not have to
				be catched explicitly.
			
			
				The most famous runtime exception is the NullPointerException, which
				occurs during runtime, when a method is invoked
				on an object, which
				actually is
				`null`
				.

					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
						href="./examples/exceptions/NullPointerException.java" />
