=== The for loop
		
			A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to
			write a block of code which is executed a specific number of
			times. The syntax is the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/loop/for.java[]
----
		
		The following shows an example for a for loop.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/loop/ForTest.java[]

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

=== The do while loop
		
			The do-while loop is similar to the while loop,
			with the exception that the
			condition is checked after the execution. The
			syntax is the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/loop/dowhile.java[]
