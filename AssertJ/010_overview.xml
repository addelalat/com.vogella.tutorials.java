		project provides fluent assertion statements for Java. These assert statements are typically used with Java JUnit
		tests. AssertJ is a fork of the Fest assert library, as the Fest is not actively
		maintained anymore.

		AssertJ is a library for simplifying the writing of assert statements in tests. It also improves the readability of
		asserts
		statements. It has a
		fluent interface for assertions.
		The
		base method for
		AssertJ assertions
		is the
		<code>assertThat</code>
		method followed by the assertion.
