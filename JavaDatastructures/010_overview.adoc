== Datastructures

Every programmer requires certain data structures for saving
several elements. Usually every programming languages provides Arrays.
These are fixed sized storage elements where every element can be
addressed via an index.  
The programmer usually requires a higher level of abstraction,
e.g. Lists,  Maps, Stacks, etc. 
The Java programming language provides these elements very
efficiently implemented in libraries. This article tries to describe
how such elements could be implemented directly with Java constructs.
The implementations in this articles are for demonstration and education purpose.
They do not try to be as efficient as the standard libraries and they
are not intended to be an replacement for the standard libraries.
