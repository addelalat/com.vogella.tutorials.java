== Map - Associative array
	 The following example is contained in the project "de.vogella.datastructures.map".
	 A map represents a data structure in which collections of
		unique key and collections of values are stored where each key is
		associated with one value. The operation of finding the value is
		called lookup.
	 A standard array is a special case of a map where the key are
		the index number of the elements pointing to the object in the array.
	
	 The standard Java interfaces for maps is import java.util.Map.
		Standard implementations of Maps are for example java.util.HashMap or
		import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap

	 A simple map with the option to add, get, remove and get the
		size of the Map could be implemented like the following. Please note
		that this map is not very fast for large sets.
	 This would be an entry.

	 This is the map implementation based on MyEntry.
