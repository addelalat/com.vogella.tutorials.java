== Stack
	 The following example is contain in the project
		"de.vogella.datastructures.stack".
	The
		stack offers to put new object on the stack ( method push())
		and to
		get objects from the stack (method pop()). A stack returns the
		object
		according to last-in-first-out (LIFO), e.g. the object which was
		placed latest on the stack is returned first. Java provides a
		standard
		implementation of a stack in java.util.Stack.
	 The following are two implementations of stacks, one based on
		arrays the other based on ArrayLists.
