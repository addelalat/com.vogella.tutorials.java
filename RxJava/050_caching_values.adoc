== Caching values of completed observables

When working with observables doing async calls on every subscription on an observable is often not necessary.

It likely happens that observables are passed around in the application, without the need to do an such an expensive call all the time a subscription is added.

The following code does the expensive web query 4 times, even though doing this once would be fine, since the same `Todo` objects should be shown, but only in different ways.

[source, java]
----
Single<List<Todo>> todosSingle = Single.create(emitter -> {
	Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
		try {
			List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice

			System.out.println("Called 4 times!");

			emitter.onSuccess(todosFromWeb);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			emitter.onError(e);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
});

todosSingle.subscribe(... " Show todos times in a bar chart " ...);

showTodosInATable(todosSingle);

todosSingle.subscribe(... " Show todos in gant diagram " ...);

anotherMethodThatsSupposedToSubscribeTheSameSingle(todosSingle);

----

The next code snippet makes use of the `cache` method, so that the `Single` instance keeps its result, once it was successful for the first time.

[source, java]
----
Single<List<Todo>> todosSingle = Single.create(emitter -> {
	Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
		try {
			List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice

			System.out.println("I am only called once!");

			emitter.onSuccess(todosFromWeb);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			emitter.onError(e);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
});

// cache the result of the single, so that the web query is only done once
Single<List<Todo>> cachedSingle = todosSingle.cache();

cachedSingle.subscribe(... " Show todos times in a bar chart " ...);

showTodosInATable(cachedSingle);

cachedSingle.subscribe(... " Show todos in gant diagram " ...);

anotherMethodThatsSupposedToSubscribeTheSameSingle(cachedSingle);
