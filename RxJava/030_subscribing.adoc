== Subscribing in RxJava

One an observable instance is available listener/subscriber can be attached.

All observable types offer a large variety of subscribe methods.

[source, java]
----
Observable<Todo> todoObservable = Observable.create(emitter -> { });

// Simply subscribe with a io.reactivex.functions.Consumer<T>, which will be informed onNext()
Disposable disposable = todoObservable.subscribe(t -> System.out.print(t));

// Dispose the subscription when not interested in the emitted data any more
disposable.dispose();

// Also handle the error case with a second io.reactivex.functions.Consumer<T>
Disposable subscribe = todoObservable.subscribe(t -> System.out.print(t), e -> e.printStackTrace());

// ...

----


[IMPORTANT]
====
There can be even more `io.reactivex.functions.Consumer<T>` for onNext, onSuccess, onFailure, onComplete and so on according to the observable type.
====



[NOTE]
====
A `io.reactivex.functions.Consumer<T>` is almost equal to the `java.util.function.Consumer` from java 8, except of that its `accept` method can throw an `Exception`. Besides that RxJava also does not depend on Java 8, but is compatible with Java 6.
====

There is also a `subscribeWith` method on observable instances, which can be used like this:

[source, java]
----
DisposableObserver<Todo> disposableObserver = todoObservable.subscribeWith(new 	DisposableObserver<Todo>() {

	@Override
	public void onNext(Todo t) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable e) {
	}

	@Override
	public void onComplete() {
	}
});
