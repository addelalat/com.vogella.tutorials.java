== Using Http get services

Several websites offer services via Http get calls. For example
your can send a get request to "http://tinyurl" or http://tr.im" and
receive a short version of the Url you pass as parameter. 
The following will demonstrate how to call the get service from
"http://TinyUrl" or "http://tr.im" via Java.
Create the Java project "de.vogella.web.get" and create the
following classes which will call a getService and return the result.
