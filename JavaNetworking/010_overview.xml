== Java and HTTP access
	<indexterm>
		<primary>HTTP access with Java</primary>
	</indexterm>
	
		Java provides a general-purpose,
        lightweight HTTP client API to access resources via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The main
		classes to access the Internet are the
		`java.net.URL`
		class and the
		`java.net.HttpURLConnection`
		class.

	
	
		The
		`URL`
		class
		can be
		used to define a pointer to
		a web resource
		while the
		`HttpURLConnection`
		class
		can be used to
		access a web
		resource.
	
	
		`HttpURLConnection`
		allows you to create an
		`InputStream`
		.
	
	
		Once you have accessed an
		`InputStream`
		you can read it similarly to an
		`InputStream`
		from a local file.
	
	
	 
        In the latest version
        `HttpURLConnection`
        supports the transparent response compression (via the header
        `Accept-Encoding: gzip`
        , Server Name Indication (extension of SSL and TLS) and a response
        cache.
    


   
     The API is relatively straight forward. For example to retrieve
        the webpage www.vogella.com you can use the following example.
    

    
        <programlisting>
            <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
                parse="text" href="./examples/http/get.txt" />
        </programlisting>
    
    
        The Javadoc of
        `HttpURLConnection`
        suggest to not reuse on
        `HttpURLConnection`
        . If you use it this way,
        `HttpURLConnection`
        has no threading issues, as it will not be shared between different
        `Threads`
        .
