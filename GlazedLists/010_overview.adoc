== GlazedLists

GlazedLists is an open source project, which is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/glazedlists/glazedlists) and is distributed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/LGPL/2.1/[LGPL] and http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/[MPL].

Basically it provides list implementations, which propagate events to it's listeners once a list is changed and also provides the possibility to transform the list, without having an impact on the original list.

Therefore it is mainly used as underlying data model for list UI widgets, like tables and trees.

It provides extensions for the UI toolkits Swing and SWT out of the box.

Also Nebula NatTable provides extensions for GlazedLists and makes use of their list implementation http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/NatTable/article.html[Nebula NatTable tutorial].
