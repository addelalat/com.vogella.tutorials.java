== Read an existing Excel Spreadsheet

	Reuse the project "de.vogella.java.excel".
		Create a package
		"de.vogella.java.excelreader" and the following class
		"ReadExcel".
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/ReadExcel.java[]
----
	
	Create an excel spreadsheet and save it somewhere,
		e.g.
		"c:/temp/lars.xls".
	

	
		I assume that the code is pretty much self-explaining. I tried
		to add lots of comments to make it easier to understand.For more
		complex examples have a look at the excellent documentation of
		the Java
		Excel API which is also part of the distribution.
