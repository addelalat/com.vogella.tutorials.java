[[createexcel]]
== Read an existing Excel Spreadsheet

Reuse the project "de.vogella.java.excel".
Create a package
"de.vogella.java.excelreader" and the following class
"ReadExcel".

[source,java]
----
include::res/ReadExcel.java[]
----

Create an excel spreadsheet and save it somewhere,
e.g. `c:/temp/lars.xls`.

I assume that the code is pretty much self-explaining. I tried
to add lots of comments to make it easier to understand.For more
complex examples have a look at the excellent documentation of
the Java
Excel API which is also part of the distribution.
