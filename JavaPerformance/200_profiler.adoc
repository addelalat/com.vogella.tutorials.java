== Using VisualVM (jvisualvm)

=== What is VisualVM?
jvisualvm is a tool to analyse the runtime behavior of your Java application.
It allows you to trace a running Java program and see its the memory and CPU consumption.
You can also use it to create a memory heap dump to analyze the objects in the heap.
	
https://visualvm.github.io/ [Visualvm] is  part of the jdk distribution (as of Update 7 for jdk1.6).
To start visualvm just click on `jvisualvm.exe` in the  `bin`  directory of your jdk installation.
If this the `bin` directory is part of your patch, you can also start it with the `jvisualvm` command.

=== Creating a heap dump with 

You can use VisualVM to take a heap dump of a local running application.
This creates a temporary file, until you explicitly save it. 
If you do not save the file, the file is deleted when the application from which you took the heapdump terminates.
