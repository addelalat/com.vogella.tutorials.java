== Just-in-time (JIT) compiler

The Java JIT compiler compiles Java bytecode to native
executable code during the runtime of your program. This increases the
runtime of your program significantly. The JIT compiler uses runtime
information to identify part in your application which are runtime
intensive. These so-called "hot spots" are then translated native
code. This is the reason why the JIT compiler is also called
"Hot-spot" compiler.
JIT is store the original bytecode and the native code in
memory because JIT can also decide that a certain compilation steps
must be revised.
