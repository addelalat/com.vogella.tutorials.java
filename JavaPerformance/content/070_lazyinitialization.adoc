== Lazy initialization
	 In case a variable is very expensive to create then sometimes it
		is good to defer the creation of this variable until the variable is
		needed. This is called lazy initialization.
	 In general lazy initialization should only be used if a analysis
		has proven that this is really a very expensive operations. This is
		based on the fact that lazy initialization makes it more difficult to
		read the code.
	 I use the project "de.vogella.performance.lazyinitialization" for
		the examples in this chapter. And a have a own field defined."

=== Concurrency - Overview
		 The simplest way is to use a synchronized block. As then field
			access is always synchronized in case on read access this variant is
			slow.
