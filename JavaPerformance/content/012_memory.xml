	<title>Memory handling in Java</title>
	<para>
		Java handles its memory in two areas. The
		<wordasword>heap</wordasword>
		and the
		<wordasword>stack</wordasword>
		. We will start with a short overview of memory in general on a
		computer. Then the Java heap and stack is explained.
	</para>
	<section id="memory_native">
		<title>Native Memory</title>
		<para> Native memory is the memory which is available to a process,
			e.g. the Java process. Native memory is controlled by the operating
			system (OS) and based on physical memory and other physical devices,
			e.g. disks, flash memory, etc.
		</para>
		<para> The processor (CPU) of the computer computes the instructions
			to execute and stores its computation results into registers. These
			registers are fast memory elements which stores the result of the
			CPU. The processor can access the normal memory over the memory bus.
			A amount of memory a CPU can access is based on the size of the
			physical address which the CPU uses to identify physical memory. A
			16-bit address can access 2^16 (=65.536) memory locations. A 32-bit
			address can access 2^32 (=4.294.967.296) memory locations. If each
			memory area consists of 8 bytes then a 16-bit system can access 64KB
			of memory and the 32-bit system can access 4GB of memory.
		</para>
		<para> An operating system (OS) normally uses virtual memory to map
			the physical memory
			to memory which each process can see. The OS
			assigns then memory to
			each process in a virtual memory space for this
			process and maps
			access to this virtual memory to the real physical
			memory.
		</para>
		<para> Current 32-bit systems uses an extension (Physical Address
			Extension (PAE)) which extends the physical space to 36-bits of the
			operation system. This allows the OS to access 64GB. The OS uses then
			virtual memory to allow the individual process 4 GB of memory. Even
			with PAE enabled a process can not access more than 4 GB of memory.
		</para>
		<para> Of course with a 64-bit OS this 4GB limitation does not exist
			anymore.
		</para>

	<section id="memory_overview">
		<title>Memory in Java</title>
		<para> Java manages the memory for use. New objects created and placed
			in the heap. Once your application have no reference anymore to an
			object the Java garbage collector is allowed to delete this object
			and remove the memory so that your application can use this memory
			again.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="memory_heap">
		<title>Java Heap</title>
		<para> In the heap the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) stores all objects
			created by the Java application, e.g. by using the "new" operator.
			The Java garbage collector (gc) can logically separate the heap into
			different areas, so that the gc can faster identify objects which can
			get removed.
		</para>
		<para> The memory for new objects is allocated on the heap at run
			time. Instance variables live inside the object in which they are
			declared.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="memory_stack">
		<title>Java Stack</title>
		<para>Stack is where the method invocations and the local
			variables are
			stored. If a method is called then its stack frame is
			put onto the top
			of the call stack. The stack frame holds the state
			of the method
			including which line of code is executing and the
			values of all local
			variables. The method at the top of the stack is
			always the current
			running method for that stack. Threads have their
			own call stack.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="Escape Analysis">
		<title>Escape analysis</title>
		<para>As stated earlier Java objects are created and stored in the
			heap. The
			programming language
			does not offer the possibility to let
			the
			programmer decide if an
			object should be generated in the stack.
			But
			in certain cases it would be desirable to allocate an object on
			the
			stack, as the memory allocation on the stack is cheaper than the
			memory allocation
			in the heap, deallocation on the stack is free and
			the stack is efficiently
			managed by the
			runtime.
		</para>
		<para> The JVM uses therefore internally escape analysis to check if
			an
			object is used only with a thread or method. If the JVM identify
			this
			it may decide to create the object on the stack, increasing
			performance of the Java program.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="memoryleaks">
		<title>Memory leaks</title>
		<para>
			The
			garbage collector of the JVM
			releases Java objects from memory
			as long as no other object refers to
			this
			object. If other objects
			still hold references to these objects, then the garbage collector of
			the JVM cannot release them.
		</para>
