== Performance factors
	
	
		Important influence factors to the performance of a Java program can
		be separated into two main parts:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				Memory Consumption of the Java program
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Total runtime of a program
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	 In case the program is to some case a program which interacts
		with others also the response time is a very important fact of the
		performance of a program.
	
		<tip> A average CPU can do approximately 1 billion (10^9) operations
			per second.
