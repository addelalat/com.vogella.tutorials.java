== Using Jacoco with Maven
	
		Jacoco can also be run during a Maven build. The results of the
		code
		coverage analysis can for example be reviewed as an HTML report, which
		usually can be found in the
		`target/report`
		folder of a built Maven project.
	
	
		The current version of the
		<code>jacoco-maven-plugin</code>
		can be found here:
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jacoco/jacoco-maven-plugin">jacoco-maven-plugin</ulink>
		on MavenCentral.
