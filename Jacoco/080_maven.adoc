== Using Jacoco with Maven
	
Jacoco can also be run during a Maven build. The results of the
code
coverage analysis can for example be reviewed as an HTML report, which
usually can be found in the
`target/report`
folder of a built Maven project.
	
The current version of the
_jacoco-maven-plugin_
can be found here:
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jacoco/jacoco-maven-plugin]jacoco-maven-plugin]
on MavenCentral.
