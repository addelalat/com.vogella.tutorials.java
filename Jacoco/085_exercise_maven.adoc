`maven-archetype-quickstart`
can be selected.

When pressing finish a new maven project is created.

=== Applying the Jacoco plugin

The complete contents of the
`pom.xml`
file should look like this:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/maven/pom.xml[]
----

=== Validate

Run the following command in the command line or via the M2E
tooling:

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/clean-verify.txt[]
----

Besides the normal Maven build a
`site`
folder will be created.

Inside this folder will be a
`jacoco-ut`
folder, which contains the test coverage analysis files.

The
`index.html`
can be opened in a browser in order to visually see the test coverage
results.
