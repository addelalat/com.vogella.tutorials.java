		<wordasword>Jacoco</wordasword>
		is an open source project, which can be used to check production code
		for code coverage. It is available under EPL-1.0.
	
	
		It can be used within Eclipse, but also in a Continuous
		Integration context. So there are also Gradle, SonarQube and Jenkins
		plugins to make these code coverage checks outside the IDE and
		therefore globally available to the development team.
