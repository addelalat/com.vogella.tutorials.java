		With EclEmma installed the context menu of a project also contains a
		<guimenu>Coverage As</guimenu>
		entry.

		And besides the debug button in the main toolbar will also be
		another button for running java code with code coverage analysis.

		Once a program is run with code coverage a Coverage View will
		show up in the Eclipse IDE.

		Usually the analysis shows up when the java application is shut
		down,
		but with the
		<guilabel>Dump Execution Data</guilabel>
		button in the Coverage View's toolbar a dump of execution data can be
		created.

		The tooling does not only show the coverage in the Coverage View,
		but also in the Java Editor itself. Tested code is highlighted in
		green and untested code is highlighted in red.
