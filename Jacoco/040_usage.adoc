== Using Jacoco in Eclipse
	
With EclEmma installed the context menu of a project also contains a
_Coverage As_
entry.

And besides the debug button in the main toolbar will also be
another button for running java code with code coverage analysis.

Once a program is run with code coverage a Coverage View will
show up in the Eclipse IDE.

Usually the analysis shows up when the java application is shut
down,
but with the
_Dump Execution Data_
button in the Coverage View's toolbar a dump of execution data can be
created.

The tooling does not only show the coverage in the Coverage View,
but also in the Java Editor itself. Tested code is highlighted in
green and untested code is highlighted in red.
