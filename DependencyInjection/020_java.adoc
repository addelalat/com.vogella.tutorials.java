== Java and dependency injection frameworks

You can use dependency injection without any additional framework
by providing classes with sufficient constructors or getter and
setter
methods.

A dependency injection framework simplifies the initialization
of the classes with the correct objects.

Two popular dependency injection frameworks are Spring and
http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/[Google Guice].

The usage of the Spring framework for dependency injection is
described in
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/SpringDependencyInjection/article.html[Dependency Injection with the Spring Framework - Tutorial].

Also
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseE4/article.html[Eclipse 4] is using dependency injection.
