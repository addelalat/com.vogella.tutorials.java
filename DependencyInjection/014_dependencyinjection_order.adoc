[[dependencyinjection_order]]
== Order in which dependency injection is performed on a class

(((Dependency injection,Order)))
According to JSR330 the injection is done in the following order:

* constructor injection
* field injection (no order in which such fields are filled)
* method injection (no order in which such methods are called)

You cannot assume that the methods or fields are called in the order of their declaration in the class.

As fields and method parameters are injected after the constructor is called, you cannot use injected member variables in the constructor.
