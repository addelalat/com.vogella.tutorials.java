[[dependencyinjection_order]]
== Order in which dependency injection is performed on a class
(((Dependency injection,Order)))

According to JSR330 the injection is done in the following order:

* constructor injection
* field injection
* method injection

The order in which the methods or fields annotated with
`@Inject`
are called is not defined by JSR330. You cannot assume that the
methods or fields
are called in the order of their declaration in the class.

NOTE: As fields and method parameters are injected after the
constructor is
called, you cannot use injected member variables in the
constructor.
