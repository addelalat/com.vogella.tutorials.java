	<para>
		According to JSR330 the injection is done in the following order:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>constructor injection</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>field injection</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>method injection</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
		The order in which the methods or fields annotated with
		<code>@Inject</code>
		are called is not defined by JSR330. You cannot assume that the
		methods or fields
		are called in the order of their declaration in the class.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			As fields and method parameters are injected after the
			constructor is
			called, you cannot use injected member variables in the
			constructor.
		</para>
