== Order in which dependency injection is performed on a class

		According to JSR330 the injection is done in the following order:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				constructor injection
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				field injection
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				method injection
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	

	
		The order in which the methods or fields annotated with
		`@Inject`
		are called is not defined by JSR330. You cannot assume that the
		methods or fields
		are called in the order of their declaration in the class.
	
	<note>
		
			As fields and method parameters are injected after the
			constructor is
			called, you cannot use injected member variables in the
			constructor.
