		Dependency injection can be performed on:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					the constructor of the class (construction injection)
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					a field (field injection)
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					the parameters of a method (method injection)
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

		It is possible to use dependency injection on static and on
		non-static
		fields
		and
		methods. Avoiding dependency injection
		on static fields and methods is a good practice, as it has the following
		restrictions and can be hard to debug.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Static fields will be injected after the first object of the
					class was created via DI, which means no access to
					the static
					field in the constructor
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Static fields can not be marked as final, otherwise the
					compiler or the application complains at runtime about
					them
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Static methods are called only once after the first instance of
					the
					class was created
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
