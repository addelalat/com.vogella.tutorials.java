== Java and dependency injection frameworks
	You can use dependency injection without any additional framework
		by providing classes with sufficient constructors or getter and
		setter
		methods.
	

	 A dependency injection framework simplifies the initialization
		of the classes with the correct objects.
	
	
		Two popular dependency injection frameworks are Spring and
		http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">
			Google Guice</ulink>
		.
	
	
		The usage of the Spring framework for dependency injection is
		described in

		.
	

	
		Also

		is using dependency injection.
