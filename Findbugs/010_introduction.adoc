== What is FindBugs
	
_FindBugs_ is an open source project for a static analysis of the Java bytecode to identify potential software bugs.
Findbugs provides early feedback about potential errors in the code. 
This helps the developer to access these problems early in the development phase. 
	
The analysis of Findbugs can be integrated into existing IDEs like the Eclipse IDE of IntelliJ.
