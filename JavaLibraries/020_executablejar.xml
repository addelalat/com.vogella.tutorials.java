== Executable JAR
(((Java libraries,create)))
	
		An executable
		JAR
		means the end-user can run the Java application
		without explicitly
		specifying the Java class which should be started.
		This is done via a
		`MANIFEST.MF`
		file which tells the JVM among other things which class
		contains the
		`main()`
		method and the classpath.
	
	
		The following example shows one possible
		`MANIFEST.MF`
		file.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/manifest/MANIFEST.MF[]
----
	

	
		An empty line is required at the end of the
		`MANIFEST.MF`
		file.
	
	
		You can create
		an executable JAR file via the following command.
		<programlisting> jar -cvmf MANIFEST.MF app1.jar *.class
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Eclipse provides an export wizard to create a JAR file which can be
		started via
		menu:File[Export > Java > JAR file]
