			A
			JAR
			file is a Java archive based on the pkzip file format. JAR
			files are

			JAR can
			contain Java classes
			and other resources (icons, property files, etc.)
			and
			can be
			executable.

			distribute your program in a jar file or you can use
			existing java
			code via jars by putting them into your
			classpath.
