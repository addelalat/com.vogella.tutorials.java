== Executable JAR

(((Java libraries,create)))
An executable JAR means the end-user can run the Java application without explicitly specifying the Java class which should be started.
This is done via a `MANIFEST.MF` file which tells the JVM among other things which class contains the `main()` method and the classpath.
	
The following example shows one possible `MANIFEST.MF`
file.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/manifest/MANIFEST.MF[]
----
	
An empty line is required at the end of the `MANIFEST.MF` file.
	
You can create
an executable JAR file via the following command.

`jar -cvmf MANIFEST.MF app1.jar *.class`
	
Eclipse provides an export wizard to create a JAR file which can be started via menu:File[Export > Java > JAR file].
