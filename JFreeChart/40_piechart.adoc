[[piechart]]
== Creating Pie Charts with JFreeChart

[[piechart_project]]
=== Create Project

Create a new Java project "de.vogella.jfreechart.swing.pie".
Create also a package "de.vogella.jfreechart.swing.pie".

[[piechart_jars]]
=== Add jars to build path of your project

In your project create a folder "lib", and paste the JFreeChart jars into this folder. 

You only need the following libraries. Please replace the version
numbers with the
version you are using.

* jcommon-1.0.16.jar
* jfreechart-1.0.13.jar

Add these libraries to your classpath. 
See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html#classpath[Eclipse Java IDE - Classpath] for details.

[[piechart_code]]
=== Code

Create the following two classes. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/pie/PieChart.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/pie/Main.java[]
----

I assume that the code is pretty much self-explaining. 
I tried to add lots of comments to make it easier to understand. 
For more complex examples have a look at the JFreeChart homepage. 

TIP: David Gilbert is also selling an excellent developer guide on the JFreeChart homepage. 
If you are intensively using JFreeChart you should buy the developer guide from David to support him and to get excellent information access.

[[piechart_run]]
=== Run

Run Main.java. The result should look like the following.
