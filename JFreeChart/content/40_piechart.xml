== Creating Pie Charts with JFreeChart
[[piechart_project">
=== Create Project
		
			Create a new Java project "de.vogella.jfreechart.swing.pie".
			Create also a package "de.vogella.jfreechart.swing.pie".
		

[[piechart_jars">
=== Add jars to build path of your project
		 In your project create a folder "lib", and paste the JFreeChart
			jars into this folder. 
		
			You only need the following libraries. Please replace the version
			numbers with the
			version you are using.

			<itemizedlist>
				*	jcommon-1.0.16.jar
	
				*	jfreechart-1.0.13.jar
	
			</itemizedlist>

		
		
			Add these libraries to your classpath. See
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html#classpath">
				Eclipse Java IDE - Classpath]
			for details).
		



[[piechart_code">
=== Code
		Create the following two classes. 


		
[source,text]
----
include::res/pie/PieChart.java[]
----
		

		
[source,text]
----
include::res/pie/Main.java[]
----
		

		
			I assume that the code is pretty much self-explaining. I tried
			to add lots of comments to make it easier to understand. For more
			complex examples have a look at the JFreeChart homepage. 
		

		
			<tip> David
				Gilbert is
				also selling an excellent developer guide on the
				JFreeChart
				homepage. If you are intensively using JFreeChart you
				should buy the
				developer guide from David to support him and to get
				excellent
				information access.
		

[[piechart_run">
=== Run
		
			Run Main.java. The result should look like the following.
