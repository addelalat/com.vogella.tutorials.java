			Download the "EclipseLink Installer Zip" implementation from the
			http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/downloads/"> EclipseLink Download Site]
			.
		
		
			The download contains several jars. We need the following jars:

				*	eclipselink.jar
	
				*	javax.persistence_*.jar
	
			</itemizedlist>
		

[[installation_database">
=== Derby Database
		
			The example later will be using
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheDerby/article.html">Apache Derby]
			as a database. Download Derby
			from
			http://db.apache.org/derby/"> http://db.apache.org/derby/]
			From this tutorial we will need the "derby.jar".
			For details on Derby
			(which is not required for this tutorial)
