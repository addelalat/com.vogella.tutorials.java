== Checkstyle Maven Plugin
	
Checkstyle can also be run during a Maven build. The
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/[maven-checkstyle-plugin]
can generate reports about checkstyle violations or can also be a part
of the build and cause a build failure when the rules defined in the
`checkstyle.xml`
are violated.
