== Exercise: Use the Checkstyle Maven plugin

=== Target

The target of this exercise is to check code being build with maven and let the build fail in case rules are violated.

=== Prerequisites

For a introduction to maven please refer to the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheMaven/article.html[Apache Maven tutorial].

=== Create a maven project

Create a quick start maven project in an IDE or by using the command line like this:

[source,text]
----
include::res/generate.txt[]
----

=== Apply the checkstyle plugin

To activate the maven-checkstyle-plugin it has to be applied to the
generated
`pom.xml`.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/checkstyle-plugin.xml[]
----

This configuration uses the
https://maven.apache.org/plugins-archives/maven-checkstyle-plugin-2.14/config/sun_checks.html">sun_checks.xml]
checkstyle rules by default. In order to specify custom checkstyle
rules a
`configLocation`
needs to be specified. See
<<checkstyle_maven>>

=== Validate

Run
`mvn clean verify`
to see all checkstyle validation failures of the generated project.
