=== Where should the test be located?
		
Typical, unit tests are created in a separate project or separate source folder to keep the test code separate from the real code.

=== Which part of the software should be tested?
		
What should be tested is a highly controversial topic. 
Some developers believe every statement in your code should be tested.
		

		
In any case you should write software tests for the critical and complex parts of your application. 
If you introduce new features a solid test suite also protects you against regression in existing code.
		
		
In general it it safe to ignore trivial code . 
For example, it is typical useless to write tests for getter and setter methods which simply assign values to fields.
Writing tests for these statements is time consuming and pointless, as you would be testing the Java virtual machine. 
The JVM itself already has test cases for this. 
If you are developing end user applications you are safe to assume that a field assignment works in Java.
		
		
If you start developing tests for an existing code base without any tests, it is good practice to start writing tests for the parts of the application in which most of the errors happened in the past. 
This way you can focus on the critical parts of your application.
