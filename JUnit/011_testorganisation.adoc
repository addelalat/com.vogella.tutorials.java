			Typical, unit tests are created in a separate project or
			separate
			source folder to keep the test code separate from
			the real code.

		<title>Which part of the software should be tested?</title>
		
			What should be tested is a highly controversial topic. Some
			developers
			believe every statement in your code should
			be tested.
		

		
			In any case you should write software tests for the critical and
			complex parts of your application. If you
			introduce new features
			a solid test
			suite also protects
			you against regression in existing code.
		
		
			In general it
			is
			safe to ignore trivial code as, for example,
			getter and setter
			methods
			which simply assign values to
			fields. Writing
			tests for these
			statements is time consuming and pointless, as you
			would be testing
			the Java virtual
			machine. The JVM itself already has
			test cases for
			this and if you are developing end user applications
			you are safe to
			assume that a field assignment
			works in Java.
		
		
			If you start developing tests for an existing code base without
			any tests, it is good practice to start writing
			tests for the parts
			of the application in which most of the errors happened in the past. This
			way you can focus on the
			critical parts of your application.
