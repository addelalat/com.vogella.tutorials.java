			The code which is tested is typically called the
			<wordasword>code under test</wordasword>
			. If you are testing an application, this is called
			the
			<wordasword>application under test</wordasword>
			.

			A
			<wordasword>test fixture</wordasword>
			is a fixed state in code which is tested used as input for
			a test. Another way to describe this is a test
			precondition.
		
		
			For example, a test fixture might be a a fixed string, which is used as input for a method. The test
			would
			validate if the method behaves correctly with this input.

			A
			<wordasword>unit test</wordasword>
			is a piece of code written by a developer that
			executes
			a specific
			functionality in the code to be tested and asserts a
			certain behavior
			or state.
		
		
			The percentage of code
			which
			is tested by unit tests is
			typically called
			<wordasword>test coverage</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			A unit test targets a small unit of code, e.g., a method or a
			class,
			(local
			tests). External dependencies should be
			removed from unit tests, e.g., by replacing the dependency with a test implementation or a (mock) object created by a
			test framework.
		
		Unit tests are not suitable for testing complex user interface or component inteaction. For this you should
			develop integration tests.

			An
			<wordasword>integration test</wordasword>
			has the target to test the behavior
			of a component or the integration
			between a set of components. The term
			<wordasword>functional test</wordasword>
			is sometimes used as synonym for integration test. Integration tests check that the whole system works as intended,
			therefore they are reducing the need for intensive manual
			tests.
		
		
			This kind of tests allow you to translate your user stories
			into
			a test suite, i.e., the test would resemble an
			expected user
			interaction with the application.

			Performance tests are used to benchmark software
			components repeatedly. Their purpose is to ensure that the code
			under test runs fast enough even if it's
			under high load.

		<title>Behavior vs. state testing</title>
		A test is a behavior test (also called interaction test) if it
			does
			not
			validate the result of a method
			call, but
			checks
			if certain
			methods
			were called with the correct input
			parameters.
		
		State
			testing is
			about
			validating the result, while
			behavior testing
			is about
			testing the
			behavior of the application
			under test.
		
		If you are testing algorithms or system functionality, you
			want to test
			in most cases state and not interactions.
			A typical test
			setup
			uses mocks or stubs of related classes to abstract the
			interactions with these other classes away
			and tests state in the
			object which is tested.
