			_JUnit_
			in version
			4.x is a test framework
			which uses annotations to identify
			methods that
			specify a test.
			The main websites for JUnit are the
			<ulink url="http://junit.org/">JUnit homepage</ulink>
			and the
			<ulink url="https://github.com/junit-team/junit">GitHub project page</ulink>
			.

		<title>How to define a test in JUnit?
		
			A
			JUnit
			_test_
			is a method
			contained in a class which is only used for
			testing. This
			is
			called a
			_Test class_
			.
			To
			write a test with the
			JUnit 4.x framework you annotate a method with
			the
			`@org.junit.Test`
			<indexterm>
				<primary>JUnit</primary>
				<secondary>@Test</secondary>
			</indexterm>
			annotation.
		


		
			In this method you use an
			_assert_
			method, typically provided by the JUnit or another assert framework,
			to check the
			expected
			result
			of the code execution
			versus the actual
			result. These method calls are typically called
			_asserts_
			or
			_assert statements_
			.
		
		 You should provide meaningful messages in assert statements so that it
			is easier for the developer to identify
			the problem. This helps in
			fixing the issue, especially if someone looks at the problem, who
			did not write the code
			under test or the test code.

			<primary>Naming conventions for test methods</primary>
		</indexterm>
		There are several potential naming conventions for JUnit tests.
			In widespread use is to use the name of the class
			under test and to
			add the "Test" suffix to the test class.
		
		For the test method names it is frequently recommended to use the
			word "should" in the test method name, as for
			example
			"ordersShouldBeCreated" or "menuShouldGetActive" as this gives a good
			hint what should happen if the test
			method is executed.
		
		As a general rule, a test name should explain what the test does
			so that it can be avoided to read the actual
			implementation.

		<title>JUnit naming conventions for Maven

		If you are using the Maven build system, you should prefer the "Test" suffix over "Tests" as the Maven
			build
			system (via its surfire plug-in)
			automatically includes such
			classes in its test scope.

		<title>JUnit test suites
		<indexterm>
			<primary>JUnit</primary>
			<secondary>Test suite</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			If you have several test classes, you can combine them into a
			_test suite_
			. Running a test suite will execute all
			test classes in that suite in
			the specified order.
		

		
			The following example code shows a test suite which defines that two
			test classes (MyClassTest and MySecondClassTest)
			should be executed.
			If you want to add
			another test class
			you can add it to
			`@Suite.SuiteClasses`
			statement.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/AllTests.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		A test suite can also contain other test suites.

		<title>Run your test from the command line
		
			You can also run your JUnit tests outside Eclipse via
			standard
			Java
			code. Build
			frameworks like Apache Maven or
			Gradle in
			combination
			with a Continuous Integration Server (like Hudson or
			Jenkins) are
			typically used to execute tests
			automatically on a regular
			basis.
		
		

			The
			`org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`
			class
			provides the
			`runClasses()`
			method which
			allows you to run one or
			several tests classes. As a
			return parameter
			you receive an object of
			the
			type
			`org.junit.runner.Result`
			. This object
			can be used to retrieve information about the tests.
		
		
			The following class demonstrates how to run the MyClassTest.
			This class will execute your test class and
			write
			potential failures to
			the console.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/code/MyTestRunner.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			This class can be executed like any other Java program on the
			command line. You only need to add the
			JUnit library
			JAR file to the
			classpath.
