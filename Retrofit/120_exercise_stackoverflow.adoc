== Exercise: Using Retrofit to query Stackoverflow in Android

StackOverflow is a popular side for asking programming orientated questions. 
It also provides a REST API which is well documented.
Queries can be build using this API. 
You find it documented via the following URL: https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/search
In this exercise you use the Retrofit REST library to query stackoverflow for tagged questions and their answers.
After authentication, you have the possibility to upvote an answer.
Please make sure, that you have a Stackoverflow account in order to get this exercise fully working.
	
We use the following query URL in our example.

=== Project creation and setup

Create an Android application called _com.vogella.android.retrofitstackoverflow_. 
Use _com.vogella.android.retrofitstackoverflow_ as top level package name.

Add the following dependency to your build.gradle file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/build.gradle[]
----

Add the permission to access the Internet to your manifest file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
		
=== Define the API and the Retrofit adapter

As we are interested in the questions and answers from Stackoverflow.
Therefore we need a data class for each of them.
Create the following two data classes named _Question_ and _Answer_.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/Question.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/Answer.java[]
----

As you can see, we store the title, the link and the id of a question.
For an answer, we store the id, the current score (the amount of upvotes) and if the answer was already accepted.

The Stackoverflow API wraps replies for questions or answers in a JSON object with the name _items_ .
To handle this, create the following data class named _ListWrapper_.
This class accepts a type parameter and simply wraps a list of objects of that type. 

[TIP]
====
The list structure is needed, as Stackoverflow wraps its answer in an item object.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/ListWrapper.java[]
----


Define the REST API for Retrofit via the following interface.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/StackOverflowAPI.java[]
----	

=== Register Application

As suggested by Stackoverflow, we use the implicit OAuth 2.0 flow here because we develop a client side application.
First, head over to http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register[Stackapps] and register a new application for your account.
Fill the mask like the following and make sure, that you check the _Enable Client Side OAuth Flow_ option.

After you registered your application, you get a _Client Id_ and a _Key_ . 
As we want to keep them out of a possible version control system, we import them into our project using gradle.
To do so, go to your gradle home directory (_.gradle/_ in your users home directory) and paste the following lines into your _gradle.properties_ file (create one, if you can't find it). 
Of course, replace _yourKey_ and _yourClientId_ with your corresponding values from Stackapps.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/gradle.properties[]
----

To later make these two values accessible in your project like normal String resources, add the following two lines to the _defaultConfig_ in your build.gradle.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/gradleDefaultConfig[]
----

One further step is required to get this tutorial working.
You need to _publish_ your app at Stackapps.
This is done by http://stackapps.com/questions/ask[asking a new question] at Stackapps with the tag _app_ .
After you successfully posted your question, copy the link of it.
Now, head back to the http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth[overview of your authorized apps], select your newly created app and paste the link of your question into the _Stack Apps Post_ field.


=== Create Activity

Adjust the _activity_main.xml_ layout or your activity.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/activity_main.xml[]
----	

Change your _MainActivity_ activity code to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/MainActivity.java[]
----	

To correctly create the views for your _RecyclerView_ , add the following _RecyclerViewAdapter_ to your project.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/RecyclerViewAdapter.java[]
----	

To handle authorization to upvote an answer, add the following activity named _WebViewActivity_.
Ensure that you also declare this activity in your manifest file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stackoverflow/WebViewActivity.java[]
----	

Basically, the WebViewActivity just starts a _WebView_ that lets you login into your Stackoverflow account to authorize this app.
After you successfully granted permission, the Stackoverflow API returns your _access_token_ to use the API functions that need authorization (we just need that for the upvote).
