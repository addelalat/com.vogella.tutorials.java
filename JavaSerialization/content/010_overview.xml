	<para>
		Via Java Serialization you can stream your Java object to a
		sequence of
		byte and restore these objects from this stream of
		bytes. To make a
		Java object serializable you implement the
		<code>java.io.Serializable</code>
		interface. This is only a marker interface which tells the
		Java platform
		that the object is serializable.

	<para>
		Certain system-level classes such as
		<code>Thread</code>
		,
		<code>OutputStream</code>
		and its subclasses, and
		<code>Socket</code>
		are not serializable. If you serializable class contains such objects,
		it must mark then as "transient".
