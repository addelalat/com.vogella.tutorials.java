== Java Serialization
	
		Via Java Serialization you can stream your Java object to a
		sequence of
		byte and restore these objects from this stream of
		bytes. To make a
		Java object serializable you implement the
		`java.io.Serializable`
		interface. This is only a marker interface which tells the
		Java platform
		that the object is serializable.
	
	
		Certain system-level classes such as
		`Thread`
		,
		`OutputStream`
		and its subclasses, and
		`Socket`
		are not serializable. If you serializable class contains such objects,
		it must mark then as "transient".
